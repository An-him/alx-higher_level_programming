## What are lists and how to use them
Lists are like Arrays in C Yet act like the array is being indexed within
>>> square = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> square
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> square = [0, 1, 2, 'Muhwezi wa', 'Jesus']
>>> square
[0, 1, 2, 'Muhwezi wa', 'Jesus']
Differences between Lists in Python and arrays and C is that Lists can be appended to
>>>square =  [0, 1, 2, 'Muhwezi wa', 'Jesus']
>>> square
 [0, 1, 2, 'Muhwezi wa', 'Jesus']
>>> square.append('Is a Wonder')
>>> square
[0, 1, 2, 'Muhwezi wa', 'Jesus', 'Is A Wonder']
commas are added aautomatcally
